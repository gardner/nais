Imagine you're playing a word game where you have to finish sentences, but you can only add one word at a time!

A "token" is like a puzzle piece - it's usually a word, but sometimes it's just part of a word or a punctuation mark.

When AI like ChatGPT writes something, it works like this:

1. It looks at all the words (tokens) that came before
2. It guesses: "What word should come next?"
3. It picks the best word and adds it
4. Then it does the same thing again for the next word!

It's like if I started: "The cat sat on the..."
- The AI thinks: "What usually comes after 'The cat sat on the'?"
- It might pick "mat" or "chair" or "floor"
- Then it adds that word and keeps going!

So "next token prediction" is just the AI playing this guessing game really, really fast - predicting one word at a time until it builds a whole sentence or paragraph!

The cool part is that the AI learned from reading millions of books and websites, so it's really good at guessing what word should come next based on patterns it has seen before.
